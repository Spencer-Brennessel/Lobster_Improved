1) Sometimes program crash? Why? add reset button?
Also, why is it not consistent???????
Like, when I keep the same alpha, i saw different thing????
Is xArray getting loaded correctly???
maybe cause of beta and different x init?
change xinit? would that change anything?

2) Add support to more Cells!!!!!!! those that are spiking only!!
3) Add max duration, and display max duration?
