1) Display the sigma and alpha and Name of the Chosen Cells
2) Want to change alpha and sigma!
5) Synapse Function, Membrane Voltage


How to edit single alpha and sigma?
need a box to choose cell Type
have to identify cell type first, like, is this bursting or spiking

Assume you tell the function this ?

Function takes in those following input(Bursting or Spiking or Endogenous?, Which cell is this?, what is alpha, what is sigma)

Function then call Init on the cell

To solve:
1) you have the cell Name, which u can get from the display cell Name, cause it's being displayed in
[cellNameTextBox setStringValue:[[[appDelegate traceSelector] traceArraytobeSent] objectAtIndex:traceIDchosen]];

2) Take this traceID, and look up whether it's endogenous or bursting or spiking? Is there a lookup table??
How to look this up?? Should I write a lookup table in resources?

3) After looking it up, we should know what parameter should be set
For instance, yes alpha and sigma for Spiking and Bursting, but not for Endogenous, for endogenous, user can also alter Alpha

4) Now that u receive alpha and sigma, you need to insert the changes into the C file --> basically call the Edit function instead of the Init function

    But what to send to C file???
how to make this changes?

5) Send the CELL NAME + alpha + sigma to a function, this function will take in the Cell Name, and decide what Struct to use, and then just change the alpha and sigma value according
Call this function CellParamsEdit(cellName, alpha, sigma)
this function will determine what struct to work with -->
