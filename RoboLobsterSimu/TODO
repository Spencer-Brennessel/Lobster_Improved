Make an array in Obj c for each of the params

Init that array for each of the Trace Id value

Everytime the user change the value in the param text box, basically just change the param array

Then, when set param is called, just convert Obj C array into C array, and pass the params!




1) When Set params, do it to all the cells, not just one cell!
So keep the state 
Do the init, but do it once


2) Therefore, need a function that takes all the input params and set them all at once
Implement this function in pc2dspLobster.c


RIGHT NOW, Everytime a params change, need to reflect that change in the Param Array??




Once this function is implemented, Load file that load param basically will use this function
EZ


1) load file
y = 1/(1+e^-x)
2) Add support to more Cells!!!!!!! those that are spiking only!!
3) Add max duration, and display max duration?
