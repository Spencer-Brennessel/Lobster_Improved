5) Synapse Function, Membrane Voltage


How to edit single alpha and sigma?
need a box to choose cell Type
have to identify cell type first, like, is this bursting or spiking

Assume you tell the function this ?

Function takes in those following input(Bursting or Spiking or Endogenous?, Which cell is this?, what is alpha, what is sigma)

Function then call Init on the cell

To solve:
1) you have the cell Name, which u can get from the display cell Name, cause it's being displayed'
